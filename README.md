# Herdr Annotator

A native code-review mod for **[Herdr App](https://herdr.dev)**. Review a branch,
the last commit, or uncommitted work. Leave comments beside the code and send
them to the agent working in that checkout. Read and reply to GitHub PR threads
in the same workspace. Local and SSH worktrees supported.

## Review → comment → send

### 1. Pick what to review

Click **Changes** for the sidebar, or the adjacent **↗** for a full review tab.
Opening full review again focuses the existing tab for that source checkout.
The full view pins your checkout and source chat, with unified or side-by-side
diffs, syntax colors, resizable panes, and expandable context.
Click **Show more context** between hunks or at the file edges to reveal
20 more unchanged lines around each change. **File ▾ → Full context** reveals
the whole file within preview limits. Expansion currently applies file-wide.
Diffs over 512 KiB or 2,000 rows stay hidden until you click **Load large diff**.
Opted-in previews support up to 8 MiB and 50,000 rows. Beyond those limits,
diffs keep a partial preview with file notes. Full review uses a virtual list;
the sidebar pages through 500 rows at a time.

Choose **Uncommitted**, **Last commit** (plus uncommitted work), or **Branch**
(since merge-base, including committed and uncommitted changes). Pick a local
base ref from the picker, or type one such as `develop` / `origin/develop` and
press Enter. Auto chooses the closer branch point from local `develop` and
`origin/develop`, so a stale local ref does not add upstream changes. No automatic fetch.

### 2. Leave comments beside the code

Click a line; Shift-click extends the range on the same diff side. Choose
**Whole file** for a file note. Save with **⌘Enter / Ctrl+Enter** or the button.
Add comments across files. Click an inline comment for **Copy**, **Edit**, or
**Delete…** actions. Deletion asks for confirmation. Unfinished comments stay
with their file and comparison as you navigate; return to continue typing.

![Selected code and a comment ready to save](docs/images/comment.png)

Saved notes survive restarts. When code moves, Annotator re-anchors notes only
to unique matching context. Outdated notes stay visible but do not enter a send.
Comment and GitHub reply text supports selection and **⌘C / Ctrl+C**. Use
**Copy…** for diff previews, selected source lines, paths, or saved comments;
cards also offer **Copy** and **Copy thread**.
Branch names and full-review checkout/file paths support selection too;
**Copy… → Copy branch** copies the exact branch name.

### 3. Send to the source session

Click **Review & send…** to open an optional **General note**, then **Send review**.
The note appears after comments and GitHub threads, can be sent alone, and is
included in exports. Cancel or Escape closes the composer without discarding it.

**Send review** submits saved comments and queued GitHub threads as one message,
with file paths and source excerpts. It uses the chat in your source tab and
accepts an idle or working agent. It never chooses another chat automatically
or bypasses permission prompts. A working agent may queue or act on the message
according to its own behavior.

**⌘Enter / Ctrl+Enter** saves the comment you are typing. With no unfinished
comments, it opens the send composer; press again there to send. One press never
saves and sends, or opens confirmation and submits it.

Full review keeps code space clear: **Review ▾** holds ordering, filters and view
settings; **File ▾** holds context expansion, file comments, copy and ask actions.

After confirmed delivery, sent comments disappear from lists, diffs, and badges.
**Show sent/resolved** reveals the history. Uncertain delivery stays visible;
check the chat before an explicit retry.

## Logical file order

Click **Order logically** in the sidebar or full review to arrange changed files
for reading. **Reset order** restores Git order. Click **AI: OpenCode / Pi** to
switch runners. OpenCode V2 defaults to the source chat's model and reasoning
variant. Click **Source chat ▾** to choose an ordering-only model or return to
automatic selection. This never changes your chat or global default. Ambiguous
session matches and remote source chats require an explicit model choice.
Both runners run on the app machine; Pi uses its configured model/auth through
local Herdr Core (`hc exec`). Each
ordering click sends one AI request with paths and bounded diff samples,
including for SSH checkouts. No tools, saved conversation, or messages to your
working chat. Pi extensions, MCP, skills, prompt templates and context files are
disabled for this call. Normal model usage costs apply. Supports 2–200 files.
The installer records executable paths, including Pi's Node runtime, so ordering
does not depend on the desktop app inheriting your shell's PATH.

## Ask without drafting a review

Right-click a source line or hunk header to ask about it. For a range, select it
and click **Ask selection**; **Ask about diff** includes the open file's diff.
Type your question, check the recipient, then **Send question**. Saved review
comments stay untouched. Questions still require an idle source agent and persist
delivery uncertainty before sending.

## Work through GitHub feedback

The **GitHub** tab reads PR review threads and polls for updates. **Fix thread**
sends one thread to the source agent; **Add to review** queues it with your local
notes. **Reply** opens a separate composer, and **Post to GitHub** posts as your
signed-in `gh` account. Sending to the agent does not resolve threads on GitHub.

![GitHub review threads and explicit reply composer](docs/images/github-replies.png)

Read/unread markers and sent/resolved filters help you find remaining feedback.
Export a review as text when you want to copy it elsewhere.

Screenshots use inert demo data. The capture fixture cannot send messages or
post replies.

## Install

Requires macOS or Linux, Herdr App, herdr-core (`hc`), Git, Rust, and Python 3.
GitHub threads also need an authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`) on the app machine.
Without `gh`, local reviews still work; the GitHub tab shows setup instructions.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jakub-tucek/herdr-annotator.git
cd herdr-annotator
python3 scripts/install.py
```

The installer builds the Rust helper and installs the native JavaScript mod.
Remote machines need no extra installation.

To use it in the existing Changes panel, clone a layout and install into that copy:

```sh
herdr-app do layout.clone '{"name":"main","as":"my-review"}'
python3 scripts/install.py --layout my-review
```

For an existing personal layout, use its name instead. The installer backs up
changes and refuses to overwrite locally edited mod files.
It also installs a private tabs mod with **[Changes | ↗]**: Changes toggles the
sidebar; ↗ opens full review directly. Shipped mods stay untouched. Rerun with
the same `--layout` to update both integrations.

## Data and delivery

Comments stay on your app machine. Git and GitHub review reads do not modify the
repository. Only **Post to GitHub** posts a reply, as your signed-in `gh` account.
An unconfirmed post keeps its draft; check GitHub before explicitly retrying.
**Send review submits with Enter**; check the chat
before retrying uncertain delivery. Diff preview limits still apply.

## Commands and integrations

Bind `annotator.submit`, `annotator.ask`, `annotator.scope`, `annotator.refresh`,
`annotator.full`, or `annotator.updates` in Herdr's `keys.json`. No global keys
change during install. Other mods can request a file's diff through
`setShared("annotator.open", …)`. See the
[command and open-file API reference](docs/guide.md#commands-and-open-file-api).

## Updates

Annotator checks GitHub for a stable tagged release once a day. **Update
available** shows the new version with **Release notes**, **Update**, and
**Later**. Open **Updates** in full review, or **↑** in the sidebar, to check
manually. Downloads/builds begin only after you click **Update**.

Save or cancel drafts in all review tabs first. The updater pauses review
editors during installation, fast-forwards the original clone to the checked
release commit, rebuilds the helper, and hot-reloads the mods. It backs up the
old install and refuses dirty/diverged checkouts or locally edited installed
files. Your personal layouts and saved comments stay in place.

Existing installs need one manual reinstall to gain this mechanism:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
python3 scripts/install.py --layout my-review
```

Use your own layout name, or omit `--layout` for a standalone install. Update
prompts follow published GitHub releases, not each commit on `main`.


## Development

```sh
cargo test --locked
npm test # Node.js 22+
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

See the [user guide](docs/guide.md) and [mod recipe](RECIPE.md) for details.

Capture the native demo screenshots on macOS with
`python3 scripts/catalog_screenshots.py --output <temporary-directory>`.
The fixture blocks network access, agent messages, and settings writes.
